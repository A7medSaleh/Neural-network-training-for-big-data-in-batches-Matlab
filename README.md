This code solves one of the biggest issues in neural networks training which is the insufficient memory for training the network with huge data sets. When the data is very big in size with so many examples the RAM size become small for the huge space needed for the training process. In this code I solve this problem using MATLAB by dividing the data into batches and then use these batches to train the network in successive iterations, of course this makes the process takes longer than in the case of using all data at once. However this is not possible because of huge memory size needed.

The code takes a .mat file as an input which saves all the data in matrix form where each row is a sample and all columns are the features values for this sample except last one which is the output for the network.
